# anki
This repository will be used to hold my Anki decks, in the form of .tex documents. I strive to keep a minimal number of decks and use tags to be able to study specific topics, rather than having a large number of somewhat related decks that all have to be studied seperately. Eventually, I will have various templates and snippets available over at my ['Keegan-Evans/templates'](github.com/Keegan-Evans/templates) repository, to aid in the creation of your own decks. There eventually will also be an article on [my website](keeganevans.com) that will detail how to setup and use decks like this. Finally, my decks are availiable to be shared and distributed, as long as you keep the MIT license and copyright information with them, as detailed in the license document of this repo. While some of my decks contain images and charts, I have tried to ensure that these are either public domain or fall under fair use for copyrighted materials; if you find something that violates one of these let me know so that I can remove it.
